      <strong>An Evening with My Brother</strong>
<p>
<em>You&#146;d think they&#146;d learn by now. You&#146;d think they&#146;d talk to each other,</em><br />
he says, shaking his head. I sit on my hands, keeping myself quiet,<br />
not saying, <em>they&#146;re stink bugs, they can&#146;t tell each other not to keep<br />
flying towards the light.</em>
</p>
<p>
Instead, I lean back on his bed, staring at the ceiling&#146;s glow. Now,<br />
we have memorized their shield-shaped bodies, copper bands<br />
of their antennae, blue-metal depressions of their backs.
</p>
<p>
They congregate, preaching from the windowsills. They hold a s&eacute;ance<br />
atop the microwave, start a book club on the top shelves, organize <br />
a rally in the pantry, beating their wings in unison. 
</p>
<p>
He has trouble falling asleep, worried that one will fly into his open mouth.<br />
I warm the milk, pour the water. We count Proth primes, let his white noise <br />
machine hum its song. None of this works. The stink bugs start a drum circle<br />
on the dresser, distracting us. <em>Let&#146;s play the what if game,</em> I suggest.
</p>
<p>
<em>
What if you could write a novel on grains of rice and string them together?<br />
What if there was a mountain with only one side? What if the stink bugs <br />
were secret agents, spying on us while we slept? </em>
</p>
<p>
We spin new machines and draw altered landscapes until I am out <br />
of words and my brother&#146;s breathing evens out. I watch him<br />
from the floor, letting the stink bugs land on my forearms, bent knees.
</p>
<p>
The lack of light makes them brave, examining my skin. I tip my head<br />
close to them, and whisper secrets of survival in their language,<br />
making <em>thwip thwip</em> sounds with my tongue, like their wings.
